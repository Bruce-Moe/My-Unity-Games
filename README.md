# My-Unity-Games
A collection of all of the Unity games I have created thus far, credits to Michigan State Coursera Game Dev Course and GameDev.tv Udemy Courses for inspiration.  
Project files/complete projects can be viewed in their respective individual respositories on my Github. These folders contain only build files.  
To play the games, download the build folder and for WebGL open the index.html in a browser that supports Unity such as FireFox. To run in standalone Windows, run the exe file.
